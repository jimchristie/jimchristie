  Working to empower and serve the people you lead is the main concept behind
  Servant Leadership. Challenging them to go farther, reach higher, innovate and
  have fun doing it requires leadership skills that are beyond the traditional
  “Command and Control” style of management. Through this course, participants
  learn and practice execution of the most critical skills needed for leading by
  serving first.
