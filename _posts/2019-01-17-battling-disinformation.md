Most everyday, I spend a bit of time on LinkedIn looking for interesting industry insights. Sometimes I see find what I'm looking for, sometimes I don't. One thing that I _always_ see is a vast array of inspirational quotes and stories. 

Today, I saw one such story like that. However, this one immediately struck me as having the ring of untruth. 

It was a story about Steve Jobs. Now, inspirational stories from Steve Jobs make up a huge percentage of those posts. That's because there's no doubt that Steve Jobs was an innovational force in his industry, to such an extent that he was a force in the world at large.  This particular story though was about his final words.

There's no doubt that this is a nice sentiment. It was also _so long_.
