title: Expanding the Lean Penny Game
snippet: >-
  One of the most fun things about training is the way that the trainees
  surprise me. At my last training session, a team floored me with their
  creative solution to the [penny game that I previously wrote
  about](/blog/lean-penny-game-for-cross-functional-teams/). Their innovation
  led them to a 40% increase in productivity.

During the second round of the game, one group stopped pulling from the backlog about midway through the "sprint." Instead, the first person in line, who would normally pull from the backlog, focused on getting work through the remaining portion of the system. The group then proceeded to clear out the early workstations, constantly focusing on later and later workstations each "day." 

The results were astounding. The group increased the number of items released to production by almost 40% and had almost no WIP at the end.
