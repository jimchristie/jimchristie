During the second round of the game, one group stopped pulling from the backlog about midway through the ten "days." Instead, the first person in line, who would normally pull from the backlog, focused on getting work through the remaining portion of the system. The group then proceeded to clear out the early workstations, constantly focusing on later and later workstations each "day." 

The results were astounding. The group increased the number of items released to production by almost 40% and had almost no WIP at the end.

I ran the game again with a few of the participants from that round, as well as a few new "guinea pigs." We played two rounds. I wasn't sure what conclusions I would get out of this, or even if there would be any, but I wanted to see it play out.

In the first round, we ran the game using the innovation that I previously mentioned. The difference this time was that we started the game knowing that this would be our approach.

In the second round, I played the role of a Product Owner who needed to accept work as done, as outlined in [SAFe's Product Owner job description](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/). This meant that I, as the PO, would no longer help with development work and that the development team could no longer help me with my work.
