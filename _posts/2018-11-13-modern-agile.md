  Lately, I've been thinking about [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/) a
  lot. It took me a while to get my head wrapped around at first, but it turns
  out that I was completely overthinking it. But after watching [Joshua
  Kerievsky's excellent
  explanation](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/videos/modern-agile/),
  I'm finally [grokking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) it.

Lately, I've been thinking about [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/) a lot. It took me a while to get my head wrapped around at first, but it turns out that I was completely overthinking it. But after watching [Joshua Kerievsky's excellent explanation](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/videos/modern-agile/), I'm finally [grokking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) it. 

You may recall that I've [written about the difference between "doing agile" and being agile](/blog/doing-agile-vs-being-agile/). Basically, people usually talk about agility as if it's something that you do. If you work in sprints, have stand ups and retros, and release code every two weeks, you're agile. But that's like saying that if you do yoga every day, you're skinny and flexible. The problem with that is that you can still overeat and not be able to touch your toes. We tend to do the same thing with our organizations. We start implementing "Agile" with a capital "A" (doing yoga) and never stop to ask ourselves if we're really improving our business agility. 

I see this more and more. I just got back from [yet another conference](https://content.jimchristie.me/work/#conferences) where I heard more people talking about Scrum and SAFe and LeSS than I did about true business agility. That's not to say those talks weren't there, they just weren't the majority. And this is a place where people who care about agility gather to try to be more agile. 

Fixing this is what modern agile is all about. It's not a methodology that consultants will sell you. It's just a set of four principles that nicely capture what the original [Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org) and its corresponding [Twelve Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) were trying to lay down.

Are your employees awesome? Are your customers? How can you support them so that they can be their most awesome?

### Make Safety a Prerequisite

Safety needs to be everywhere. We need social safety so that people can voice their opinions. We need safety to try new things without fear of failure. We need safety in our deployment pipeline through automated tests. We need to be able to deploy rapidly in case those tests fail.

### Deliver Value Continuously

This is where old school Agile falls the furthest behind. "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." A couple of weeks is no longer good enough, and a couple of months is an eternity. I also really like the focus on delivering _value_ here.

### Experiment and Learn Rapidly

This is the core of business agility.
