You don't have to look too hard to find articles about the impending, or even already complete, [death of agile](https://www.google.com/search?q=agile%20is%20dead&cad=h). The general gist of these articles all seems to be that agility has evolved from its initial conception into a consultant's toolbox of frameworks to rigidly to apply to organizations without any consideration for whether or not the framework fits. Agile has become a noun rather than an adjective. 

Agilists talk about the rituals, processes, and roles as if those things are agility.
