### Wednesday

Wednesday was laundry day. I started off the day by heading to what was possibly the nearest laundromat. I had scoped one out earlier that I thought was closer, but I couldn’t find it that morning. No worries, there was another one handy. The New York laundry experience was pretty much what I would have expected: cramped, crowded, and boring. Still, the clothes got clean, nothing was stolen, and no one screamed “Washington!” at me.

After the laundry was done, I hit The Met. I knew that this was a must because:

1. I majored in art (and philosophy).
2. One of my bus tour guides said, “They got everything in there. They got two of everything in there.”

There were paintings by Jackson Pollock, naturally. He was a New York artist. Kind of a no brainer.

I’m not really a fan of Pollock. I know that he was influential in his time, and basically paved the way for abstract expressionism and [one of my best paintings](/art/untitled/), but come on! How many times can one guy paint the same painting?

I saw a few Picasso’s there, but the most interesting was definitely this bronze sculpture.

I had no idea that Picasso did any sculpting and I never would have guessed that he was working in _bronze_! I usually think of bronze as something that basically fizzled out at the end of the Renaissance. It’s bizarre to think of a 20th century artist doing it.

There were several giant rooms filled with sculptures.
