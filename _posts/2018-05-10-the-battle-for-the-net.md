Unless you've been living in a hole, you've probably heard that net neutrality is under attack from the FCC. Over the next weekish, a number of websites will be engaged in a campaign to lobby the Senate to vote to block the FCC's repeal of net neutrality. As a supporter of an open internet, I have decided to participate in this campaign.

Many of the arguments around net neutrality focus on business objectives. 

Proponents argue that the open internet allows start-ups to grow unhindered by fees that would hypothetically be put in place by ISPs. If the start up wouldn't or couldn't pay the fee, they would have to suffer slower bandwidth. 

Opponents argue that net neutrality has stifled innovation by ISPs. This argument relies on data that shows that investment into infrastructure has gone down since net neutrality rules were put into place. Thus, if the rule were lifted, those investments would return. 

There are certainly other arguments for and against net neutrality, but those are the two that seem to get bandied about the most.  My guess is that it's because both of them seem to have concrete, real world implications. But I think that there's a more important argument.

Revoking net neutrality threatens our First Amendment right to freedom of expression.  

As more and more corporations merge to form conglomerates, it's more and more likely that the content creators will be bought by or sold to the content conveyors. The [AT&T merger with Time Warner](https://www.google.com/search?q=at%26t+time+warner&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqrYvM-_vaAhXqzIMKHQgrA8IQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=959) is a current example of such a merger. When considering this merger in conjunction with the loss of net neutrality, there are two important things to keep in mind:

1. CNN is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which is owned by Time Warner
2. Internet Providers such as ISP now have the right to block competitor content simply because it is competitor content

This means that AT&T could block all of the major news networks, forcing their customers to get their news primarily from CNN.  What's worse, because ISPs are public utilities, and public utilities are considered to be [natural monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly), they are allowed by government regulations to control geographic regions.
