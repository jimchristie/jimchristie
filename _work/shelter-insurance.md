Shelter Insurance is a 70 year-old agent focused insurance company serving 18 states. As part of an initiative to attract a more diverse customer base through an online system, Shelter launched a subsidiary company called Say Insurance. As part of this initiative, Shelter chose to experiment with agile development methodologies.

As one of six trainers at Shelter, I have been instrumental in the process of designing and implementing an agile training program at the organization. We have developed the content and curriculum for this program, and have delivered several agile training sessions. We are currently engaged in establishing a regular and repeating training schedule within the organization.

In my coaching role, I work with other coaches to facilitate organizational improvements within Shelter programs and through the organization as a whole. As new teams are trained in agile methodologies, it is one of my primary responsibilities to coach those teams following training to better facilitate the application of their newly learned practices.

In addition to organizational coaching and training, I am also engaged as a Scrum Master on a development team within the Say initiative.

Accomplishments:

* Worked with other teams and our Program Manager to improve our program level demos for greater collaboration
* Worked with a group of Scrum Masters and Product Owners to create, facilitate, and evolve a training program for new employees and employees new to agile
* Mentored new Scrum Masters in their new roles
