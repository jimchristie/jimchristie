Daniel Boone Regional Library is a public library system consisting of three branches and serving two counties in mid-Missouri. As a senior member of the Information Technology team, I was an instrumental figure in planning and executing IT initiatives, as well as overseeing daily maintenance and security of library systems. 

Primary Achievement:
In my relatively short time in this role, I conceived, designed, and built a system for displaying meeting room reservations.
