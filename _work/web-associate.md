The three branches of the Daniel Boone Regional Library system serve the information needs of over 200,000 people. As one of two web associates, I was jointly responsible for designing and coding all of the library’s web applications, both internal and external. 

Major achievements:
- Conceptualized, designed, and launched a web application tool for program registration. Through this process, I collaborated with and user tested my application with internal employees, who were the end users of the application.
- Through statistical analysis, I identified several areas of improvement to the library’s existing website. By evaluating usage, I was able to modify the content and design of prominent areas of the site to facilitate access to content that users found more desirable.
