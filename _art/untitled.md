  This was a project in a painting class in college. The assignment was to
  create a painting by pouring paint on the canvas. This was the second
  iteration of this assignment. The first was criticized by the professor as
  being too layered. My professor didn't like that he cold tell the order that
  the paint was poured onto the canvas, though I disagreed. However, in the
  interest of getting a good grade, I pushed my painting as far from that
  criticism as I could. This was the result, which I have been incredibly
  pleased with.

  Acrylic on canvas. Applied by mixing paint with water and pouring it onto the
  canvas. I then manipulated the canvas to force the paint to flow in different
  directions.
