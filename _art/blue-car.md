  This was a 3x5 photo of me and my dad. The photo was grainy in addition to
  being small, making the painting incredibly difficult. It took me almost two
  years to complete, but I was incredibly pleased with the results.

  Digital. Primarily done on a Samsung Note Pro with the AutoDesk SketchBook
  app. However, I tinkered with other programs as well.
